In this notebook we load and examine the Gapminder data.


```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r loaddata, echo=FALSE}
# By putting the loading code in a separate chunk, we can still see any 
# messages that may be printed when it loads.  This is useful, since
# messages here could indicate a problem.
gapminder <- read_csv("../data/gapminder-FiveYearData.csv",
                      col_types = cols(
                        country = col_character(),
                        year = col_integer(),
                        pop = col_double(),
                        continent = col_character(),
                        lifeExp = col_double(),
                        gdpPercap = col_double()
                      ))
```

Let's take a look at the data:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
print(gapminder)
```
