In this notebook we load and examine the Gapminder data.

Firstly, we load the required libraries and data:

```{r setup}
library(tidyverse)
```
Then we load the data

```{r loaddata}
gapminder <- read_csv("../data/gapminder-FiveYearData.csv",
                      col_types = cols(
                        country = col_character(),
                        year = col_integer(),
                        pop = col_double(),
                        continent = col_character(),
                       lifeExp = col_double(),
                        gdpPercap = col_double()
                      ))
```

Let's take a look at the data:

```{r printdata}
print(gapminder)
```
